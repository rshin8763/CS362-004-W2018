Bug #1 Action value update error in Great Hall card

Priority: High

Severity: Medium

Version: sandifes-assignment-4/projects/sandifes/dominion_bugs
Is it reproducible: Yes. This bug occurs every time by simply calling
cardEffect(great_hall, 0, 0, 0, &gameState, handPos, &bonus) where handPos
contains the location of the great_hall card in hand.

Summary: The number of Actions available to the player after playing Great Hall is not
what it should be. The assertion that the card gives +1 to numActions failed.
After checking the gameState after the adventurer cardEffect was called, it was
found that the action value was not changed. Instead, numActions should’ve been
incremented. Other aspects of the greatHall card passed the tests.

Bug #2 Adventurer card only draws coppers instead of all treasures

Priority: Medium

Severity: Medium

Version: sandifes-assignment-4/projects/sandifes/dominion_bugs
Is it reproducible: Yes. This bug occurs every time by simply calling
cardEffect(adventurer, 0, 0, 0, &gameState, handPos, &bonus) where handPos
contains the location of the adventurer card in hand.

Summary: The Adventurer card only draws copper cards. I ran my adventurer random test
suite and found that all 10,000 iterations failed. After looking at an example
pre and post gameState I found that while the number of treasures that the hand
had was 2 greater as expected, the new cards were all value 4, or copper. Then,
looking at the discard pile, which has cards drawn from the deck that were
considered not treasure cards, I found multiple silvers and golds that were
discarded. There is likely an error with the conditionals that determine
whether a certain card is treasure or not. 

Bug #3 Smithy draws too many cards

Priority: High

Severity: Medium

Version: sandifes-assignment-4/projects/sandifes/dominion_bugs
Is it reproducible: Yes. This bug occurs every time by simply calling
cardEffect(smithy, 0, 0, 0, &gameState, handPos, &bonus) where handPos contains
the location of the smithy card in hand.

Summary: The smithy card drew 9 cards instead of the expected 3.  The smithy card was
discarded afterwards so at least that functionality worked as expected. None of
the other player’s cards or states were changed. In addition, none of the other
gameState variables seemed to be changed. The bug seems to be only that smithy
drew 9 cards instead of 3.

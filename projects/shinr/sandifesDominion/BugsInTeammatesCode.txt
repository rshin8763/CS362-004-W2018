BUG REPORT

Bug #1 – Action value update error in Great Hall card
Priority: High
Is it reproducible: Yes

Summary:
The number of Actions available to the player after playing Great Hall is not
what it should be. The assertion that the card gives +1 to numActions failed.
After checking the gameState after the adventurer cardEffect was called, it was
found that the action value was not changed. Instead, numActions should’ve been
incremented. Other aspects of the greatHall card passed the tests.

Suggestion: 
Check the method that contains the code for adventurer in dominion.c, and make
sure that state->numActions is correctly incremented. 

Bug#2 – Adventurer card only draws coppers instead of all treasures
Priority: Medium
Is it reproducible: Yes

Summary:
The Adventurer card only draws copper cards. I ran my adventurer random test
suite and found that all 10,000 iterations failed. After looking at an example
pre and post gameState I found that while the number of treasures that the hand
had was 2 greater as expected, the new cards were all value 4, or copper. Then,
looking at the discard pile, which has cards drawn from the deck that were
considered not treasure cards, I found multiple silvers and golds that were
discarded. There is likely an error with the conditionals that determine
whether a certain card is treasure or not. 

Suggestion:
Check the method that contains the code for adventurer in dominion.c, and make
sure that the conditionals are correctly identifying copper, silver and gold as
treasure cards. 


Bug #3- Smithy draws too many cards
Priority: High
Is it reproducible: Yes

Summary:
The smithy card drew 9 cards instead of the expected 3.  The smithy card was
discarded afterwards so at least that functionality worked as expected. None of
the other player’s cards or states were changed. In addition none of the other
gameState variables seemed to be changed. The bug seems to be only that smithy
drew 9 cards instead of 3. 

Suggestion:
Check the method that contains the code for smithy in dominion.c and make sure
exactly 3 cardDrawn() function calls are made.
